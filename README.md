Proof of Concept - Is it possible to generate a font via code

## Babysteps - How does one create a simple font?
###1. Start by hand
Whenever designing a font, one should start by drawing/designing a few letters to get a feel of what the font should look like.
Often called 'control characters', you would start designing the latin characters:

'n' and 'o' - lowercase letters.
'H' and 'O' - uppercase letters.

Consequently, you would add more letters to those to form the word: _adhesion_. This word is often use to get a feel of how the typeface should be proportioned.

###2. Digitize your drawings
Outline your drawed letters and fill the insides with a black marker. Take a picture with your smartphone and upload it to your computer.

###3. Choose your software
Unfortunately, creating typefaces seems to be a Mac business. Most people recommend software like [Glyps](www.glyphsapp.com) or [RoboFont](http://doc.robofont.com/). I cannot use these apps, so I will need to find a Windows alternative. FontLab Studio seems to be a common program to use, although be it with a learning curve.

###4. Use the software
There seems to be some documentation online. However, the program will require some training. Now draw a few letters that you have drawn with your hand before.
